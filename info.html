            OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.<br>

            Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</ul>

            Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:<br>

            <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute<br>
            <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs<br>
            <li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug<br>
            <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li><br></p></article></section>

                <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language.<br>

                    Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object.<br> The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
                    
                    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.<br>

              <p><li>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</li><br>

                    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.<br>
                    
                    Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.<br>
                    
                    Why use methods? <br>To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.<br>
                    Create a method named myMethod() in Main:
                <code>

                    public class Main {
                      static void myMethod() {
                        System.out.println("Hello World!");
                      }

                <p>The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:<br>

                    1.declare class variables/attributes as private<br>
                    2.provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable<br>
                    <code>public class Person {
                        private String name; // private = restricted access
                      
                        // Getter
                        public String getName() {

                        }

                <header><b>Inheritance</b></header><article>
                <p>In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:<br>

                    1.subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class<br>
                    2.superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from<br>
                    To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.<br>
                <code>final class Vehicle {
                    ...
                  }
                  
                  class Car extends Vehicle {
                    ...
                  }</code></p></article>

            <section class="main-section" id="Polymerphism">
                <header><b>Polymerphism</b></header><article>
                <p>Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.<br>

                    Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. <br>This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
                    <br>
                    For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound().<br> Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.) </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
                <header><b>Abstraction</b></header>
                <p>Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.<br>
                    Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).<br>
                    
                    The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:<br>
                    
                    Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).<br>
                    
                    Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).<br>
                    An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:<br>
                <code>abstract class Animal {
                    public abstract void animalSound();
                    public void sleep() {
                      System.out.println("Zzz");
                    }
                  }</code></p></article>
